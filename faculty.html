<h2>1. Mrs. VARSHA AGARWAL</h2>
The seniormost teacher and head of Yashi Coaching Classes.She led the foundation of YCC.She is a versatile teacher and is engaged in education, since 2000. She is having vast experience of teaching students of all classes.She specialises in maths and physics. All those associated with a pass of life called tuition is familiar with the name and through to be part of this coaching class. Not because the cable showed their cast on TV, nor because they were lured by discounts and not in the least because they were promised merits and rank but only because of `varsha ma'am`.This casual occupation took her by storm to have a full fledged coaching building with a cycle of batches pouring in every day. From early morning to night. From ninth, tenth, and other professional exam and tutorial, Varsha has unknowingly established an academic empire in a span of just a few years. How did she do it? "I just don`t know" comes the reply. No publicity, nor any leaflets but the student continued to pour in. How did she manage it? " I am up to my neck with batches and do not know how to stop those children beseeching me to take them on roll in my coaching class" She says baffled. she has no discrimination hierarchy. she only insists on high level of sincerity in studies. And of course ... percentage is one of the criteria support the potential of the word. But not a rigid rule. If she is convinced the boy or girl deserves a place in her class, she does not think twice before letting him or her in. But if she feels his efforts are being exploited, she would not shun any moment of denial, to who so ever it maybe. No threats of bribes can stop this Taurus from changing her course of action.Her personal involvement in each of her pupils, in class out of it too, has brought about this magical magnitude to her coaching classes. Sheer truthfulness of behavior. she visits each one of them with a personalized card, and an inspiring message before the board exam. she plans a self funded picnic for each year with fun and frolic for a healthy interaction as a conclusion to classes. And she even manages to accomplish those altruist missions around her for her friends, relatives and other. From 6 am to 9 pm she is on her toes in lecture. After that there is counseling for parents and wards. And not to be talk about the administrative entanglements that need her attention all the time. A single handed but teamed enterprise of systematic management of coaching is the synonym of this coaching .<br>
